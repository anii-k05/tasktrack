# TaskTrack - Scalability Analysis & Production Readiness

## Architecture Overview

TaskTrack is built with scalability in mind using a modern, decoupled architecture that separates concerns between frontend and backend.

### Current Stack & Scalability Features

**Frontend (React.js)**
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- React Router for client-side routing
- Axios for efficient API communication
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**
- RESTful API design
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Prisma ORM for database abstraction
- Environment-based configuration

**Database**
- MySQL with proper relational structure
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexed queries for performance

## Scalability Strategies Implemented

### 1. Horizontal Scaling Ready
```javascript
// Backend is stateless - ready for load balancing
// JWT tokens enable seamless horizontal scaling
app.use('/api', authMiddleware); // Stateless authentication
